<h> My capstone project </h>

<p> In my capstone project, I am looking at public transport data from the Leeds metropolitan area. Through data analysis, I aim to see which postcodes could benefit from more public transport services.</p>
<p> I will be looking through Leeds Travel To Work Survey data and also traffic volume data from various cameras in the Leeds area.</p>
<p> I hope you enjoy it! (Tom Habin) </p>
